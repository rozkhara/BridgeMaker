# BridgeMaker
Pressing 'A' generates all possible bridge states and saves it internally.  
Pressing 'G' sets Bridge List in Bridgemaker to state when the sum of distance of every bridge is the greatest.  
Pressing 'L' sets Bridge List in Bridgemaker to state when the sum of distance of every bridge is the least.  
* Pressing 'G' and 'L' generates all possible bridge states, if not already made.  

Should there be any update to the original position lists, press 'R' to reset the saved states, then press 'A', 'G', or 'L' to regenerate bridge states.
